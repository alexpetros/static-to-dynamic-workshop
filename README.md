# Static-To-Dynamic Websites < 60 Minutes

This is the code from a workshop I did about making dynamic websites.
The first live workshop took place at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=044d120abf1c334d0b2a3132634eb025).

I may try to do more of these in the future, and expand on this repo as a result.
For the time being, feel free to use this as an ExpressJS project starter.
I use a [slightly more convenient SQLite wrapper](https://github.com/alexpetros/copy-this-code/blob/5e2542a1f8100f1d09fdb0dd5352de1b3ae46f75/js/sqlite-driver.js) usually, but this is otherwise exactly how I make professional web services.

The code here is 0BSD licensed, and free to use for whatever purpose.
If you happen to have a recording of the workshop this license does not apply to that.
